PowerBi is Microsoft tool which helps us to visualize the data, ETL process and build a dashboard

We all would have heard a word called "Marketing"

What is Marketing?🤔
Marketing has a great impact on today's world.We could see marketing everywhere and for every kind of products. In simple " Marketing is a process of satisfying customers need, through various challenges and calculation those needs are achieved to popular that brand in efficient way."👍🏻

Marketing can be done in many ways,But why do we need social media in marketing🤷🏻‍♀️?
Social Media Marketing,only social media can reach wide range of audience and interact with them, directly know their feedbacks,it's cost effective and it is the best platform to popular the brand.

I hope you all agree with me that..." We never go to sleep without scrolling social media." Am I right?

I have built a dashboard using PowerBi Desktop for the dataset of "Social Media Marketing Analytics"
You can see the major platforms used in social media, the shares,reach,clicks, comments, impressions, content type,engagement rate of posts and their aggregates
